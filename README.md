# Zero-Knowledge Neural Architecture (ZKNA)

## Overview
Zero-Knowledge Neural Architecture (ZKNA) integrates Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) and Multi-Party Computation (MPC) to build privacy-preserving machine learning models. This framework ensures that sensitive data remains encrypted during training and inference, while still allowing for model validation using Zero-Knowledge Proofs.

## Features
- **Privacy Preservation**: Uses homomorphic encryption to keep data secure during processing.
- **Multi-Party Computation**: Distributed training and inference across multiple parties without exposing raw data.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Verifies results without revealing sensitive data.
- **Scalable**: Can be applied in various sectors like finance, healthcare, and more.
